C# and .Net I have learned in programming bootcamp. I know how to create `REST API's` and by using `Asp.Net MVC` and `Razor Pages` frameworks, create Full Stack Web Applications. 

Databases I have used in my projects: `PostgreSQL`, `MySQL`,  `SQLLite`

`Python`is my first programming language. I am a big fan of Python as it is very flexible, 
dynamic and easy to learn. It supports perfectly `Object-Oriented` and `functional`programming. 
I have created few web applications using `Flask` web framework. It is perfect for small web applications. Flask is easy to use and fast to learn.
I have looked into `Django` web framework. It is more suitable for bigger and more complex web applications. In one of my first progects I have used `Tkinter` to create simple Desktop applications. Additionaly, I am familiar with `Beautiful Soap` library for web scraping in Python. 
 
I have used lately Javascript and Typescript with Front End web Framework `React`.

I have used  `Heroku`, `Netlify` and `Azure Cloud` to deploy my web applications.

I am familiar with `Bootstrap` and `SASS` for styling. However I prefer styling all from scratch with plain CSS. I do feel that in this way I have more control and flexibility for changes.

I have worked with different IDEs like `VS Code` `Visual Studio` `Atom` `Rider` `PyCharm` `Sublime`. My favourite at the moment is `VS Code` as I highly appreciate its simplicity, lightweight and efficiency. 

I am very good at `CTRL+C & CTRL+V` and `Google`ing. <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tarikul-Islam-Anik/Animated-Fluent-Emojis/master/Emojis/Hand%20gestures/Clapping%20Hands.png" alt="Clapping Hands" width="25" height="25" />
